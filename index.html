<h3>Why It Was My Favorite</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi" target="_blank"><strong><em> Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi </em></strong></a> was one of my favorite movies as a child for many reasons. I remember having it both on dvd and vhs because I enjoyed it that much. I think that the story was so simple that I was able to understand it but it was also colorful, the ending was one that I enjoyed, and I liked all the effects with the lightsabers. Even now I enjoy the movie but not as much as I used to. I think that it has lost some of its charm and the new movies are no where as good.</p>

<h3>My Favorite Scene</h3>
<p>As I previously stated I really enjoyed the ending and I think that is because of the fight scene with Luke and Darth Vader. I was glad that the good side won of course but having Darth Vader turn to the light side before dying was a turn in the story that I did not expect.Having Darth Sidious fall to his death was satisfying as he was completely evil but that did not even matter because he magically came back in the most recent movie. I also think that the scene is just iconic and the clash of green and red just makes it stand out even more. Also being able to see Darth Vader's face made the scene more sentimental as it was truly like a father and son connecting.</p>
